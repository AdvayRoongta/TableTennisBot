<h2>This is a 1-axis robot that will play table tennis with me when no one else will.</h2>

This uses a vslot with a gantry plate on top. Connected to the gantry are my camera and paddle. The gantry will move based on camera input to the motor, which is connected to the gantry via a belt. The goal is to move along one axis to return the ball. The camera uses a simple contour recognition to find the ball and uses the ball's coordinates to see if it in the mid, left or right of the view.


# It has:
<h3>An ESP32-S3-EYE Microcontroller and Camera, along with a matching mount.</h3>

# Why

Most Table Tennis robots are developed at Google Deepmind or MIT. Although they are way better than mine, they cost thousands of dollars to make and develop. I made mine to just return the ball to a simple practice shot, rather than all different possible shots. I also really like playing table tennis and there is not always someone to play with me. Practicing by myself is really hard since my garage is cluttered and the balls get lost easily.
